<h1>Why I like football</h1>
<p> Football is fun because you can play freely and I love the control and how we play the game it is overall fun my favourite position varies from fullback to winger to sometimes striker.<br>
But my favourite is winger because in my opinion because there is nothing more fun then driving down the wing and skilling people it is so exilirating also it is so easy to cut inside and shoot and crossing/passing is so fun<br>
because you can get easy assists sure your striker must be in a good position but still in my opinion football is the best sport to ever exist</p>
